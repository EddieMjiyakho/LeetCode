## 📈 **How I Approach Problems**
1. **Understand** – Read and break down the problem statement.
2. **Plan** – Identify the best approach (brute force, optimized solution).
3. **Implement** – Code with clarity and best practices.
4. **Optimize** – Improve time and space complexity.
5. **Review** – Test edge cases and analyze performance.
